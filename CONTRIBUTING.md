# Contributing

First, thank for contributing to WingOS !  <3

if you want to make a pull request you have to respect some points:

## commit

### commit name

when you make a commit it is best to form it like this:
`[topic] change`

for exemple:
`[kernel] added sys$kill syscall`

### commit size
please try to make several small commits when possible, avoid big commits

## coding style
the coding style can be applied just by running clang format (or `make format`)
